We are developing Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet software application. Excel needs to allow users to organize, format, and calculate data with formulas using a gridded system of cells. Key features include: A grid interface where users can input and manipulate data. Support for various data types including numbers, text, and dates. A comprehensive formula system allowing complex calculations and data analysis. Charting and graphing capabilities to visually represent data. The ability to format cells, rows, and columns for improved readability. Functions for sorting and filtering data. Support for multiple worksheets within a single workbook. The capacity to import and export data in various formats. Pivot tables for data summarization. Macros and VBA for automation and custom functionality. Collaboration features allowing multiple users to work on the same spreadsheet. The software needs to be user-friendly for beginners while offering advanced features for power users. It should be performant, capable of handling large datasets, and integrate well with other Office suite applications. The interface should be intuitive, with a ribbon-style toolbar for easy access to features. Excel needs to support cross-platform functionality, working on Windows, macOS, and have web and mobile versions. It should also offer cloud storage and syncing capabilities for easy access across devices.
